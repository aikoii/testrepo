* **Stage 1: Forking and Cloning** The first step in contributing to Rocket.Chat is to fork the project on GitHub and clone it to your local development environment. This allows you to work on your changes in a controlled environment without impacting the main project.
* Stage 2: Create a Branch It's best to create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix. This helps to isolate your changes and makes it easier to track the work that has been done.
* Stage 3: Implementing ChangesThis is the stage where you write your code. Make sure you follow Rocket.Chat's coding standards and guidelines ensure consistency and maintainability. Your code should be clean, well-commented, and tested thoroughly.
* **Stage 4: Committing Changes** Once you've made your changes, you need to commit them. Each commit should be a single logical change, and the commit message should describe what the change does, why it's needed, and any potential implications it may have.

  1. JCal - #1 Tech & Business Podcast Hands Down
     1. Press never wants to cite All-In.
  2. Friedberg - They claim they are doing it to avoid questioning from journalists.
  3. JCal - People feel like they want a fair shake.
  4. Sacks - Why go through their filter when it's always a hit piece?
  5. Friedberg - There are real journalists out there.
  6. Sacks - They want to have influence, that's why journalists do what they do.
  7. Chamath - Difference between interest percent and basis point. Way off on math in his article then.
     1. Shows that all kinds of trash must get through.
     2. So numerically illiterate. This was an easy catch.
  8. **Note: Agreed. Scary how much of public opinion is most likely based on false info.**
  9. JCal - The test about industry expertise.
  10. Sacks - Jellman amnesia effect. Worse than this though.
  11. **Note: Gell-mann Amnesia Effect deleted on Wikipedia? Well, cited under Michael Chricton.**
  12. Friedberg - Getting a total kick out of the headline article with Sacks, Elon, Thiel.
