From large pieces of [basswood](https://www.wood-database.com/european-lime/), artist [Christian Verginer](https://verginer.org/) carves figurative sculptures that meld the play and wonder of adolescence with the vitality of the natural world. Leafy branches grow like pigtails, a bird perches on the zipper of a hoodie, and two young boys sit on ladders that lead to treetops and clouds. Textured by small gouges, the works contrast realistic renditions of children with fantastical elements, the latter of which the artist tends to paint in a single color like vibrant green, slate gray, or[ beige.](rebecca-greens-work.md#author-based-in-michigan.)
