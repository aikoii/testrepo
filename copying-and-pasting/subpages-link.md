From the sinuous lines of a leaping cat, to a giant tortoise gliding alongside a snorkeler, to a lone cyclist illuminated on a road juxtaposed against a looming city, the winning images from this year’s [Sony World Photography Awards](https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards) ([previously](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2022/03/sony-world-photography-contest-2022/)) showcase a remarkable slice of life captured by photographers hailing from 55 countries around the globe. Now in its 16th year, the competition garnered more than 415,000 entries from more than 200 nations and territories, about half of which were entered into the running for the National Awards, an initiative set up by the World Photography Organization and Sony to support local photographic communities around the world.
