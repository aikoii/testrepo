[As reported](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/14/im-not-littering-the-nanofiche-is-very-small-meet-the-man-who-sends-art-to-the-moon) by _The Guardian_ earlier this month, no nation owns the moon, although an unratified United Nations treaty states that any use should be universally beneficial. The momentum of the lunar race has subsequently sparked conversations about [space colonialism](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/04/end-colonial-approach-to-space-exploration-scientists-urge) and the potential for destruction, although Peralta reminds those concerned that the technology is designed to store a lot of information in very small spaces.

Ultimately, the _Lunar Codex_ is optimistic, with a hope that future generations—or whoever stumbles upon the archive—will find joy and insight in the collections. Peralta told _The New York Times_ that he considers the project “a message in the bottle for the future that during this time of war, pandemic, and economic upheaval people still found time to create beauty.”
